# Employee-Record-Management-Portal
A Flask-based Employees Management System that allows administrators to manage active employees and ex-employees, view detailed employee profiles, upload documents/photos, and mark employees as inactive with an automatic leaving date.

This project is designed for internal HR/Admin usage with a clean UI, role-based access, and a clear separation between active employees and ex-employees.
